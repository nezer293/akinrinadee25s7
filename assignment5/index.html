        <h2>The Trouble with Bears</h2>
        <p><strong>By Evan Wild</strong></p>
      </header>

      <p>
        Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real live bears of this world are proud, independent creatures, self-serving and always on the hunt for food. Nothing like the bears you see on TV, like Baloo from renowned documentary, <em>The Jungle Book</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        So what are bears really like, and why does the world's media portray them with such a skewed vision? In this article we try to answer those questions, and give you a real insight into the life of the bear.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Types of Bear</h3>
        <p>
          Bears come in two varieties — large and medium. You don't get small bears. If you have seen a small bear, then it was in fact probably a baby bear (cub) from another species.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bears can also be classified in terms of their habitat — both large and medium bears are just as at home in urban areas as they are in the countryside. Different habitats encourage different behaviour, as you'll find out below. The table below also gives you some useful facts about bears.
        </p>

        <h3>Habitats and Eating Habits</h3>
        <p>
          Wild bears eat a variety of meat, fish, fruit, nuts, and other naturally growing ingredients. They will hunt for food themselves in woodland or rivers, but at a push they will track down sustenance from farms or country houses. They tend to live in isolation, in caves, tents, or cottages.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
          Urban (gentrified) bears have largely abandoned the old ways. They will hunt other urban creatures if necessary (including other predators like rats and foxes), but prefer to scavenge from dumpsters, bins, and fast food joints. When food is scarce, they may break into people's kitchens and steal essentials like baked beans or microwave ovens.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
          Urban bears will sleep anywhere they can, from bus shelters and parks, to fast-food restrooms, to their own apartment.

        <h3>Mating Rituals</h3>
        <p>
          Bears are romantic creatures by nature, looking for a mate for life. They woo partners by making their dwelling attractive — cave paintings or reed beds for wild bears, and mood lighting with Michael Bublé for urban bears.
        </p>

        <p>
          The audio clip below contains more details about bear mating rituals, with expert commentary.

                Oh I am so glad you taught me all about the big brown angry guys in the woods. With their sniffing little noses and their bad attitudes, they can sure be a menace — I was thinking of putting them all in a truck and driving them outta here. I run a zoo, you know.
